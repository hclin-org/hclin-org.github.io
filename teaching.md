<p>Teaching is integral to my scholarly identity and one of the most rewarding aspects of my career. I find particular joy in helping students learn to think strategically, apply analytical tools, and translate theory into practice. Over the course of the semester, students progress from learning foundational frameworks to diagnosing organizational issues and recommending actionable solutions. At the heart of my teaching is a commitment to creating an engaging, inclusive classroom where students become critical and creative thinkers prepared to lead in complex environments.</p>
<br />
<p>I have a strong record of teaching effectiveness, supported by both quantitative and qualitative evidence. As a PhD student, I have taught recitations for Business Policy and Strategic Management, the capstone course for all business undergraduates at Michigan State University. In my most recent term (Spring 2025), I received a score of 4.46 on a 5-point scale for teaching effectiveness across two sections, exceeding the departmental average of 3.72. Students have consistently noted that I (1) communicate expectations clearly, (2) connect strategy frameworks to real-world cases, and (3) foster an engaging and respectful classroom for discussions. Students also reported that the structured discussions enhanced their ability to analyze strategic issues and develop strategic insights.</p>
<br />
<p>Beyond evaluations, I was awarded The Colleges’ Online Learning Academy (COLA) Teaching Fellowship, a university-level teaching fellowship to enhance teaching effectiveness.</p>
<br />
<p>I design my courses as inquiry-based learning experiences. Before major assignments are due, I reserve time for structured brainstorming. I begin with a brief recap of a key framework (e.g., Porter’s Five Forces) relevant to the upcoming assignment. Students then work in small groups on one randomly assigned question from that assignment. During this time, I circulate to observe group dynamics, answer questions, and prompt deeper analysis. We reconvene for a class-wide debrief, where groups share their findings. From both small-group and class-wide discussions, students have opportunities to compare approaches and refine their arguments before submitting their work. This structure promotes collaborative problem-solving, gives students ownership of their learning, and emphasizes low-stakes iterations rather than one-shot evaluation, mirroring the way strategy is developed in practice.</p>
<br />
<p>Collectively, my inquiry-based, student-centered pedagogy supports diverse student cohorts in applying strategic thinking to real-world challenges and developing as reflective business leaders.</p>
