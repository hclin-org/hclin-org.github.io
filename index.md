I am a PhD student in Management at <a href="https://www.msu.edu/" target="_blank">Michigan State University</a>, <a href="https://broad.msu.edu/" target="_blank">Eli Broad College of Business</a>. As a student of organizational theory, I am mesmerized by "what makes organizations so similar?" - the values and legitimacy that drive organizational isomorphism. The expansion of finance in the economy, reified in private equity and venture capital, has held my empirical attention. More recently, the growth of blockchains, either as a technology or as an asset class, encourages me to delve into the process of structuration. Taken together, my research enterprise aims to illuminate the mechanisms of financialization and how organizations gravitate towards the financial imperative.

Please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you are also interested in financialization and blockchains!
